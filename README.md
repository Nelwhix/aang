# AANG
A CLI tool to prepare frontend applications for deployment

## USAGE

### Installation
```bash
    npm i -g aang
```

To see all the command line flags and options
```bash
    aang -h
```

## Why not Github actions?
Github actions is a fantastic tool for automating tasks like this, but I recommend aang because it has less mental overhead. just create a aang.txt file with your scripts and you are good to go
